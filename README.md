Xpand's XDP hackathon codes and Tables

Table 1. E3 ligases are enriched in the XDP cells of fibroblasts, induced neurons, and neural stem cells, as well as in all cell types, as compared with the controls. All the raw data are retrieved from nference.

Most of the enriched E3 ligases enriched in both induced neurons and neural stem cells cannot be targted. The only targettable gene, RNF8 is low in its expression difference, so it also might not serve as a good target. 

Table 2. NEDD4-1 pathway genes enriched in XDP induced neurons as compared with control. Retrieved from nference.

Table 3. ROS related genes(Retrieved from PMID: 27252846) are enriched in the XDP cells of fibroblasts, induced neurons, and neural stem cells, as well as in all cell types, as compared with the controls.

Table 4. Endosomal (KEGG:hsa04144) and lysosomal (KEGG:hsa04142) related genes are enriched in the XDP cells of fibroblasts, induced neurons, and neural stem cells, as well as in all cell types, as compared with the controls.

Table 5. NEDD4 degrades a apoptotic prevention factor IGF1's receptor (PMID: 22875931) and a stress responding factor HSF1 (PMID: 26503960) via UPS system, causing apoptosis. They are downregulated in induced neurons.

Table 6. Apoptosis related genes(KEGG:hsa04210) are enriched in the XDP cells of fibroblasts, induced neurons, and neural stem cells, as well as in all cell types, as compared with the controls.

Table 7. Drug tragets and their mechanisms from literature search.
