Xpand's XDP hackathon codes and Tables

Table 1. E3 ligases are enriched in the XDP cells of all different defined cell types as compared with the controls, as well as in general. 
Most of the enriched E3 ligases enriched in both induced neurons and neural stem cells cannot be targted. The only targettable gene, RNF8 is low in its expression difference, so it also might not serve as a good target.
