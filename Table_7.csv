Targets,Drugs/Inhibitors,Notes
NEDD4 aka NEDD4-1 ,Curcumin ,Lowers protein levels of NEDD4-1 in glioma cell. (PMID: 28627598) The mechanism of action is through SCF/β-TRCP-mediated degradation but also produces ROS which needs further studies before being applied. (PMID: 28535906)
,Benzimidazole,Bind Nedd4 in a side chain mediated way that does not alter its conformation or ubiquitination kinetics in vitro. Stimulates the action of Nedd4 towards ubiquitination of trafficking-associated proteins against ¦Á-Synuclein toxicity (PMID: 33176158)
,Indole-3-carbinol (I3C),bind to the purified catalytic HECT domain of NEDD4-1 to inhibit its actions in skin cancer (PMID: 27979631)
,Warfarin,NEDD4 levels is assoicated with dose in patients (PMID: 27488176)
Indirect targets,Fostamatinib,"The active metabolite of fostamatinib, R406, is an inhibitor of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) 2. It binds reversibly to the ATP binding pocket with high affinity (Ki = 30nM), inhibiting the kinase activity with an IC50 of 41nM. (PMID: 33023353)"
,Nilvadipine,inhibit SYK activation by decreasing phosphorylation in mice model of TBI (PMID: 33076989)
