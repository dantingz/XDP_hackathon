Targets,Drugs/Inhibitors,Notes
NEDD4 aka NEDD4-1 ,Rapamycin (sirolimus, everolimus, and temsirolimus), The upregulation of NEDD4-1 is specifically abolished by rapamycin in vivo through the PI3K/PTEN-mTORC1 pathway (PMID: 25157163)
,Curcumin ,Lowers protein levels of NEDD4-1 in glioma cell. (PMID: 28627598) The mechanism of action is through SCF/β-TRCP-mediated degradation but also produces ROS which needs further studies before being applied. (PMID: 28535906)
,N-aryl Benzdiimidazole,Binds Nedd4 in a side chain mediated way that does not alter its conformation or ubiquitination kinetics in vitro. Stimulates the action of Nedd4 towards ubiquitination of trafficking-associated proteins against ¦Á-Synuclein toxicity (PMID: 33176158)
,N-aryl Benzimidazole,promote endosomal trafficking through Rsp5/Nedd4 and thus ‘reset’ vesicle trafficking homeostasis. (PMID: 24158909)
,Indole-3-carbinol (I3C),Binds to the purified catalytic HECT domain of NEDD4-1 to inhibit its actions in skin cancer (PMID: 27979631)
Indirect targets,Candesartan cilexetil,"Effective on preventing α-synuclein-induced microglial activation in vivo (PMID: PMID: 25969543)"
,Salbutamol, "agonist of β2AR, which has ligands that modulate SNCA transcription through histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation of its promoter and enhancers. (PMID: 28860381)"
