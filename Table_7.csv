,Curcumin , Yes (PMID: 34681908),Needs delivery (PMID: 32473377),In Phase-III trial, Lowers protein levels of NEDD4-1 in glioma cell. (PMID: 28627598) The mechanism of action is through SCF/β-TRCP-mediated degradation but also produces ROS which needs further studies before being applied. (PMID: 28535906), "antimicrobial & cancer drug"
